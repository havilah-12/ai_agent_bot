# ai_agent_bot

## 🧠 Overview
This project is a multi-modal AI chatbot agent that uses Large Language Models (LLMs) to answer user queries, perform real-time web searches, and execute tool-based workflows. Built with LangChain, LangGraph, and FastAPI, the system showcases a modular and scalable architecture for deploying LLM-powered applications.

## 🚀 Features
🔗 LangChain-powered LLM agent with tool invocation (search, code execution, more)

🌐 Tavily API integration for real-time web search results

🧠 Supports LLM inference via Groq API or OpenAI

⚙️ LangGraph used for managing complex multi-step agent flows

🔧 REST API built with FastAPI for backend logic and integration

🖥️ Frontend built with Streamlit for user interaction

🗂️ Modular and deployment-ready structure
