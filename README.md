# ai_agent_bot

## ðŸ§  Overview
This project is a multi-modal AI chatbot agent that uses Large Language Models (LLMs) to answer user queries, perform real-time web searches, and execute tool-based workflows. Built with LangChain, LangGraph, and FastAPI, the system showcases a modular and scalable architecture for deploying LLM-powered applications.

## ðŸš€ Features
1. LangChain-powered LLM agent with tool invocation (search, code execution, more)

2. Tavily API integration for real-time web search results

3. Supports LLM inference via Groq API or OpenAI

4. LangGraph used for managing complex multi-step agent flows

5. REST API built with FastAPI for backend logic and integration

6. Frontend built with Streamlit for user interaction

7. Modular and deployment-ready structure
